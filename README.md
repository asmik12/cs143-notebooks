# Notes: Database Management Systems

Class website: https://remy.wang/cs143/index.html.

Note that this webpage will likely change for future offerings, just under the same URL.

## Overview

Some lecture notes for the UCLA Spring 2025 offering of [COM SCI 143: Database Management Systems](https://catalog.registrar.ucla.edu/course/2024/comsci143?siteYear=current) with [Professor Remy Wang](https://remy.wang).

These [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org) notes are designed to supplement the lecture slides, database files, and any other resources Professor posts to the class website. The idea is to introduce a more textbook-like format alongside the more visual slides to reduce the need to go back and watch recordings because of something you missed.

I'll take notes live during lecture, refine them offline, and upload them to this repository. I try to organize the notes and leave no queries unexplained, so bear with me if I lag behind a bit.

## Disclaimer

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> I'm fairly confident in their accuracy, but as of now the notes are not officially reviewed/endorsed by Professor. If you spot discrepancies, use Professor's material as the source of truth. Better yet: open an issue/pull request! I'm more than happy to help anyone farm GitHub contributions ðŸ˜‰

## Usage

### Browsing GitHub

GitHub has great support for rendering Markdown, including [Mermaid diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org) and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org), both of which I use extensively for more expressive note-taking. Clicking on a specific `.md` file directly in the browser should bring you to a fully rendered version of that notebook.

> [!WARNING]
>
> If you're a nerd like me that also uses the [GitHub mobile app](https://github.com/mobile): unfortunately, Markdown rendering seems to be much more limited there. At the time of writing this, both Mermaid and LaTeX do not render.

### Viewing Markdown Files Locally

You can also clone this repository to browse the notes as files on your filesystem with whatever editor or preview app of your choice.

> [!TIP]
>
> If you're viewing a source file in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), you can use <kbd>Ctrl/&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>&#8679;</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> to jump to a symbol in the current editor and <kbd>Ctrl/&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> to jump to a symbol in the entire workspace. For Markdown, that corresponds to headers, so you can use that to preview the outline and jump around.

> If you're viewing these source files on [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), you can use <kbd>Ctrl/&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>&#8679;</kbd>+<kbd>V</kbd> to render the Markdown in a separate tab (or <kbd>Ctrl/&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> <kbd>V</kbd> to open it to the side) and read that one.

### Exporting Markdown to PDF

There are [many ways to do this](https://gist.github.com/justincbagley/ec0a6334cc86e854715e459349ab1446), but I personally use the [Markdown PDF extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzane.markdown-pdf) in [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to export my documents. After you install the extension, simply go to the `.md` file you want to export, open the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl/&#8984;</kbd>+<kbd>&#8679;</kbd>+<kbd>P</kbd>), and search for **Markdown PDF: Export (pdf)**.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Documents that use LaTeX expressions may need a [special `<script>` element](https://github.com/yzane/vscode-markdown-pdf/issues/21#issue-220517238) appended at the end to help this extension correctly render the math expressions, something I had trouble getting to work with the other methods.

> Alternatively, using [**pandoc**](https://pandoc.org) should have built-in support for exporting Markdown with LaTeX, as [recommended by Professor himself](https://github.com/vinlin24/cs143-notebooks/issues/1).
