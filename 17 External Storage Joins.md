# 2025-05-27/Lecture 17: External Storage Joins

## B+ Trees (Continued)

### Insertions and Deletions Clarified

Following the confusion caused by an oversight in Lecture 16 (Ed #107), this lecture clarifies some cases in B+ tree insertion and deletion. I've updated the notes in the Lecture 16 notebook for those topics; go see them there.

## External Storage Joins

TODO. Will update later. Professor confirmed with me that next quiz (2025-05-29) will be on B+ trees and not external storage joins, so don't worry.
